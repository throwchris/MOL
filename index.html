    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>"I praise God for the revelation that we do not have to die, Amen." Rose M. Aluli</i></p>
    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>This message was given to the Church on February 17, 1980.</i></p>
    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>Through the power of the Holy Ghost we can overcome everything, including the last enemy, which is death, and live and rule and reign on this earth for
    our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ.</i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Does everybody know what has to be taken out of us, that there is a root that we are born with: the Adam nature that we are born with?  
        We had nothing to do with it.  We cannot enter the kingdom with any of that root left in us.  The scriptures are very plain on it.  We cannot come in to the kingdom.  
        Flesh and Blood cannot inherit the kingdom.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify">Everything has to be consumed by the Spirit of God to where there is no flesh will that could oppose the will of the Spirit or the will of God, 
        because we would make shipwreck – just the same as Adam did – of the kingdom.  And this time God is going to have a kingdom where we will rule and reign in 
        righteousness, and it will be exactly that.  So, all of this Adam nature must be burned out of us as we yield to the Spirit.  It must be.  We cannot come in.  
        We cannot. And we can only do it as God deals with us, and be willing to put everything out of our lives.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">Now it is just plain – that we cannot come into the kingdom with this.  Every one of us is born with it; every one of us has it.  
        And God has dealt with all of us in different ways, and we keep playing around, but the time is ticking away, and getting shorter and shorter and shorter, 
        and one of these days when that door is shut, it is shut!  And the end of grace period will be gone, and you cannot do anything about it.  
        You just go the way of flesh. We cannot come into the kingdom except we become righteous even as he is righteous, Amen.  And it has to be done by the Spirit, Amen.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify">I do not feel that we can leave this thing hanging out here.  We need some real scriptures, some real truth, to prove what we are saying here.  
        I want to just do enough so people will have an understanding. Now first, the scripture says Adam was created in the image and likeness of God.  He was pure, holy, and set over the works of God’s hands.  
        Adam was limited.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong>Genesis 1:26-30</strong></span><strong> 
        And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, 
        and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and 
        female created he them. And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish 
        of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which 
        is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. And to every beast of the earth, and 
        to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.</strong></p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">Now Adam was limited to the things, to the works of his hands here on the earth.  He had dominion over those things, but in Christ, we will have dominion 
        over all things – all things.  I’m going to read this first part again.  Adam was created in the image and likeness of God.  Well then, he could not die, could he?  Because 
        you cannot kill God or you cannot kill Christ in his resurrected body, can you, because he is flesh and bone (but we will get into that later).  He was pure and holy and 
        set over the works of God’s hands until disobedience came.  
        Then death and decay set in. Instead of pure water, or spirit, bitter and sweet started flowing from him, and thorns and briars started to grow and finally choked out 
        all the good, or spirit, and death came to mankind.  (We’ll get into scriptures so I will prove all of this.)  This man is again being restored into the likeness of the 
        Father and Son, this new man in Christ. Through Christ’s death and resurrection, the process of Adam is being reversed.  Now this is the day and this is the age, 
        this is the end of time when everything is lining up exactly according to the scriptures, when this process, God has promised, will be reversed.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">We are born in sin, something we had no choice in, being born in the Adamic nature.  And as we accept Christ, or this life giving Spirit, 
        Christ starts the reverse action.  Well, we know that sin, the curse of the Father on Adam, was death.  He said, "If you do this you will die."  
        So there had to be a change in his body that he became flesh and blood.  He was not made that way.  He says, “You are bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh” in the 
        first chapter of Genesis (I do not want to get too far into that yet).  Through disobedience, Adam started death working in him.  He was made in the exact image of 
        God and of Jesus Christ, and he could not die.  Jesus had to come to earth and become a man with flesh and blood.  This is why Jesus said, "Flesh and blood cannot 
        inherit the kingdom," but flesh and bone can.</p>
      
    <p class="w3-right-align" style="opacity: 0.5">page 2</p>
    <hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray">      
    

    <p class="w3-justify">Through Christ, we receive life and the process starts to change us back to that immortal being Adam started with, when we get saved.  
        If we just stopped, that is as far as we would go, but we found out that there are some new things in here – the mysteries of God, that have been revealed by 
        the Spirit – that go far beyond just being a Son of God.  Amen. Through Christ, we receive life and the process starts to change us back to that immortal being Adam 
        started with. Through obedience to the Word of God left for us, or pattern of examples from past history of men’s lives; if we obey the truth in the Word – Christ – 
        we will find our way back into that perfect relationship Adam had in the beginning, where sin and death are destroyed.  Doesn’t the Bible say, “Be ye perfect, even as 
        your Father in heaven is perfect”? All right. That’s just a little opener here.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">When Adam and Eve sinned, they became flesh and blood bodies.  Before that, they were made exactly in the image of the Father and Christ.  
        They could not die.  And you remember how he set a sword out there, a flaming sword, so that they could not, in their sinful state from disobedience, take of the tree 
        of life and live forever.  Now we know that.  So there had to be a change.  Death started working in Adam the minute he sinned, and in Eve.  Then the curse came, 
        which was death, so that they could die.  They could not die if they did not have blood, because the Bible plainly states the life is in the blood.  So when they were 
        first formed, they had bodies like Jesus’ resurrected body.  Jesus said, “I am flesh and bone.” </p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">The Spirit was their source of life, not blood, in their original creation.  If you don’t believe it, you have to go back and read what the Word says.  
        Adam in the very beginning, he said to Eve, “You are bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh,” and then Jesus says, “A spirit hath not flesh and bone.”  And he said, 
        “Handle me and see,” and he showed them his hands and his side.  So you see, he cannot die. There is a change that we do not exactly understand.  But we know that when 
        this root of sin is completely destroyed, then the curse of death is gone and the transformation will take place.  Otherwise, then the Scripture is a lie if it says 
        that we are going to be changed without death.  We have to believe what we hear, what we read, what the Word of God says.
        They immediately knew that they had sinned and covered themselves with leaves.  Our vile bodies must also be changed like unto his glorious body, after his resurrection, and in the twinkling of an eye.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong>Genesis 1:26-28</strong></span><strong> 
        And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them</strong> First, he said ‘let us make man’ and then he said ‘let us make them’. 
        <strong>and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping 
        thing that creepeth upon the earth. So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. And God blessed 
        them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl

     <!--   
    <p class="w3-justify" >No Blood.  God breathed life in Adam.  He just breathed life into him, by the Spirit.  
        But the blood is the beast nature in man.  That uncontrollable beast nature is in the blood.  I have such a study on this, but I am just going to touch on it 
        a little bit; what the blood of Jesus Christ really – why it was necessary for him to become a flesh and blood man.  Through the shedding of his blood, that was death.  
        Actually, the death is in the blood that Adam and Eve inherited after sin.  God said to Cain, "The voice of thy brother’s blood crieth out from the ground," when he was 
        killed.  Adam was formed after the pattern and likeness of Jesus and God, a body that could not die, flesh and bone.  After sin entered in, death came upon him.  
        A change.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">Genesis 2:23-24 
        And Adam said, To Eve This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man. Now we are taken – a church was 
        born out of the side of Christ as that blood was spilled.  Amen. Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be 
        one flesh. Adam was first formed and kept by a body like Jesus after his resurrection: flesh and bone.  This is our change.  After sin came, his life was in his blood, 
        subject to death.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">Ephesians 1:7 
        In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace; 
        His blood was given for the forgiveness of sin.  Sin caused the curse and caused the blood to be in Adam and death, so that he could die. He could not die before, 
        until he became blood.  So that had to happen.  It took the blood of Jesus to redeem us; to redeem us, not just cover our sins; but it took the blood of Jesus and 
        the spilling of his blood to redeem us from that curse, that flesh and blood man; and bring us back into that flesh and bone man.</p>   
    
     -->   
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong>Luke 24:39</strong> 
        <span class="w3-text-red"><strong>Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.</strong></span> 
        The reason I am reading it is because this is God’s Word, this is not my word, Amen.  And we have to believe every word, and every little dot, and every tittle.  
        That is what it says.  We have to believe what this Word says, that he was flesh and bone, the same as Adam was.  And Adam was first created in that image with no 
        death.  So we know that sin, this Adamic nature is the only thing that hinders, that causes us to die.  And Jesus made the way, so that when all sin is gone and the 
        root of sin is completely removed out of us, then the action is reversed and we live forever without death. It is very plain.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><strong>John 5:26</strong> 
        <span class="w3-text-red"><strong>For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself; 
        Now, if the Son is in us, and he gets complete control and all of the Adamic nature is taken out of us, then that life just naturally has to come forth.  There has to 
        be a change.</strong></p>
        
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong>John 20:21-22</strong> <strong>Then said Jesus to them again,</strong> <span class="w3-text-red"><strong>Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you.</strong></span>
        <strong></span>And when he had said this, he breathed on 
        them, and saith unto them,</strong> <span class="w3-text-red"><strong> Receive ye the Holy Ghost:</strong></span> All right, now you see when he first sent them out ‘As the Father hath sent me so send I you’.  Now that is what 
        he is saying to us again, to complete that work in us.  We are his disciples also.  As the Father had sent Jesus into the earth to do this work that he might be a 
        complete man, that the Adamic nature and everything would be taken out, he says 'so send I you'.  And as he was in the earth, so are we.  So he has sent us.  ‘And when 
        he had said this, he breathed,’ he gave them that power by the breath.  Remember how Adam lived, because God breathed the breath of life, eternal life, into him.  
        The life of the Spirit, the life of God, that eternal life that cannot die was breathed into him.   
    <!--    
    <p class="w3-justify">These scriptures that he is giving us now are showing that this end time people, this kingdom people, will be in the likeness, in the image,

        But you can keep walking before God in the Spirit until we are free from that root of sin, a thing at a time.  We could not stand it if he pulled it all out at once.

        I want to show you that baptism does not cleanse the flesh.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">1 Peter 3:21 
        The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) 
        by the resurrection of Jesus Christ: It does not put away sin, this sin nature.  Baptism can only wash us as a testimony and so on and so forth.  But it cannot 
        destroy this thing in us.  The baptism, it cannot.  I mean the water baptism, it cannot destroy this.  It helps.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">1 Peter 3:20-21 
        Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, 
        eight souls were saved by water. The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer 
        of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ: This cannot put away the filth of the flesh because we are born with an Adamic nature that will not quit sinning.  Now that is all.
        (A question is asked: So, did water baptism, prefigured in Noah, show that it did not completely cleanse the flesh?  Is that it, Rose?)  Right, 
        because that Adam nature was still in him, and we know what the life of Noah was.  And that same race has come right on up, because he left Noah in that same Adamic 
        nature that man started out with at the beginning.</p>

        Now it is a very serious thing to hear this message and not try to do something about our lives. that servant which knew his lord’s will and prepared not himself, 
        There is something WE have to do.  WE have to do this.  When once we have a knowledge of the root of sin in us, and we keep feeding on that thing and living on that 
        thing and doing the will of the flesh, and we do not seek God and resist evil and resist sin, then we ‘shall be beaten with many stripes,’ Amen.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">2 Corinthians 5:1-4 
        For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. For in this 
        we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven: If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.  And we cannot take on 
        this new house as long as there is sin in there, Amen.  He said, "We do groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon," with this house from heaven. For we that are in 
        this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life. All right now, to ‘be 
        unclothed’; what that means is that the spirit would leave this body.  That is what it is saying, not that we would be unclothed.  Not that we would die, in other 
        words, but that we would be clothed upon by that Spirit of life, that everlasting life, that we do not have to taste death.  Now who cares about death?  I could care 
        less one way or another.  But the thing is, that I want to help fulfill the Word of God in the age that I am living in.  And this Word is true; this is God’s Word.  
        And so the flesh groans constantly, hating death, being afraid of death.  If you have not overcome that, then that is a terrible thing.  I do not have that any more, 
        praise God.  I died too many times, or come right up to the gate, and the Lord has let me live.  But there is an overcoming there.  So he says ‘this flesh continually 
        groans’ to overcome this, this death, that this life will come to us.</p>

        Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself. 
        This vile body, this sinful body must be changed and fashioned like unto his glorious body after he was resurrected, a flesh and bone body, without sin, and not 
        subject to any of the elements of the earth; nothing, no walls, no nothing.  (That’s just a terrible illustration, compared to the power of Jesus and the 
        inheritance that we will inherit in him.)  He said that this body must be changed.  This vile body, this sinful body, this body of death, this corrupted sinful body 
        must change and take on the glorious body of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>
    
    
    <p class="w3-justify">Hebrews 2:13-14 
        And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me. Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, 
        And blood, see here is that word: flesh and blood, not flesh and bone as Adam was and as Christ was, Amen. he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through 
        death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; All right, what did he do?  He went down into hell, after he became a flesh and bone man, 
        he went down into hell and he took the keys of death, hell and the grave.  Of death, you hear me, and of hell, you hear me, and the grave.  Now that was the work that 
        Jesus died for, that he might deliver us from death, hell and the grave.  How much plainer do you want it?  Amen.  He came and had to take part of the same, as we are, 
        flesh and blood; that he might die and receive that body, that we would not have to.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">1 Corinthians 15:44-52 
        It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body. And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a 
        living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit. Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is 
        spiritual. The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven. As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, 
        such are they also that are heavenly. And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly. Now this I say, brethren, that flesh 
        and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption. This body has to be changed. Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all 
        sleep, but we shall all be changed, In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, 
        and we shall be changed. Christ after the resurrection became as Adam was before sin.</p>   
  

    <p class="w3-justify">1 Thessalonians 5:9-10 
        For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ, Now, I want to say something.  We have not obtained salvation.  If you know 
        what salvation means, it is complete redemption.  People call being saved, salvation.  That is not complete. You are forgiven when you are saved.  If you study the 
        scriptures, you will find out that you are forgiven, you are forgiven; the blood has covered your sins.  But salvation means a complete work.  We are being saved, we 
        are obtaining complete salvation, Amen. Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him. Whether we die or whether we live, we will 
        be with him, Amen.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">2 Thessalonians 1:10 
        When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day. 
        2 Thessalonians 1:12 That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
        That pretty well speaks for itself, but we can comment a little on it.  There is a believing here isn't there?  ‘When he shall come to be glorified in his saints.’  
        Now we know that Christ lives in us, the hope of glory, Amen.  He lives in us.  When Jesus said, "When they say lo here and lo there, don’t hear them; don’t follow 
        after them", because Christ is here, in us.  So where are you going to go looking for him?  That is false.  They are false teachers.  Christ is in here and this is the 
        place where the kingdom of God is without observation.  The kingdom of God is without observation; you cannot see it in other words, because it is here in us.  This is 
        where his kingdom is.</p>   
   

    <p class="w3-justify">1 Thessalonians 4:14-17 
        For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, 
        that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. Amen, that explains itself. For the Lord himself shall descend 
        from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall 
        be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord. So, as a witness and as a testimony, we know what he 
        is speaking here.  You are not caught up anywhere, you are caught up in the Spirit, Amen.  (We completely proved that yesterday, by scriptures.)  It is an awakening of 
        the dead.  And like you say, how high is air?  Nine miles, Amen.  There have been so many airplanes crisscrossing across this air place here, I am sure there is no 
        kingdom up there, Amen, in that air, Amen.  And he said you are caught up in the air, Amen.  And when he put man on the earth and there are so many scriptures for this 
        that it is ridiculous that anybody could ever believe that we are going to be carried off somewhere.  It is just absolutely ridiculous.</p>
    
    
    <p class="w3-justify">esus had to die and shed his blood to kill that first man, Adam.  I always wondered what the blood of Jesus really did. It destroyed the curse, or the 
        man of sin Adam took on when he sinned, when he became a flesh and blood man. We must understand this or we will miss the whole thing.  The curse that Adam took on was 
        death.  Wasn't it?  That was the curse.  But in the original beginning, he was made like unto God the Father and Jesus Christ.  He said, "Let us make man in our image."  
        Well, they could not die, and they did not have blood.  Jesus said, "Restore unto me the glory that I had with thee from the beginning."  So, in the beginning he was flesh 
        and bone, not flesh and blood.  And that is where we will come to.  That will be the change.  But, are you afraid of it?  You will be a lot smarter than you are now when 
        we come into that state, because we will know all things at that time.  This corruptible blood body must be changed into his beautiful resurrected body.  Then death shall 
        be done away with.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">By the way, when the Lord gave me that vision and showed me his beautiful hands of his resurrected body years ago, I have had a longing for that ever 
        since, because there is no way that I can describe the beauty of that flesh.  It is simply something that you cannot explain, but he was as plain as I am looking at you 
        or anyone else.  But it was just his hands and his garment; he did not show me his whole body but he showed me the beautiful flesh of his hands.  And he was so intimate 
        about it with me, so secretive about it and so loving and so close to me and I said, "Lord."  I had such a desire.  I was crying out to God and I was saying, "Oh Lord, 
        I have such a desire to know what this is all about."  I really wanted to know what kind of a change, what kind of a body we will have.  “And what is your resurrected 
        body; what did it look like?”  It is no wonder they did not recognize him.  I mean it, because that flesh is something beyond anything that you can imagine, and every 
        one of us will receive a change, a new body, a flesh and bone body that is going to be like unto his glorious body.</p>   
  

    <p class="w3-justify">John 5:26 
        For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself; 
        Now, if the Son is in us, and he gets complete control and all of the Adamic nature is taken out of us, then that life just naturally has to come forth.  There has to 
        be a change. John 20:21-22 Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you. And when he had said this, he breathed on 
        them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost: All right, now you see when he first sent them out ‘As the Father hath sent me so send I you’.  Now that is what 
        he is saying to us again, to complete that work in us.  We are his disciples also.  As the Father had sent Jesus into the earth to do this work that he might be a 
        complete man, that the Adamic nature and everything would be taken out, he says 'so send I you'.  And as he was in the earth, so are we.  So he has sent us.  ‘And when 
        he had said this, he breathed,’ he gave them that power by the breath.  Remember how Adam lived, because God breathed the breath of life, eternal life, into him.  
        The life of the Spirit, the life of God, that eternal life that cannot die was breathed into him.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">Galatians 3:3 
        Are ye so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh? 
        Do you think for one minute that we can come into this relationship and get rid of this curse of sin through any works of the flesh?  Absolutely not.  
        It is everything is by the Spirit.  As we let this life, this eternal life, this Jesus Christ, this life man live in us and take complete control of our bodies 
        and of our spirits and of our soul; as we completely give over everything, every part of us unto him, this life just naturally has to come forth.  That is the 
        only way that it can come forth. Ephesians 1:7-14 
        In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, Through his blood, that is the forgiveness of sins, like we said before, that is what the 
        blood was for. according to the riches of his grace; Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence; Having made known unto us the mystery of his 
        will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself: And what was the purpose of the Father? That we be Sons.</p>   
   

    <p class="w3-justify">That we might be rulers of the earth again in Jesus Christ, the body of Christ; that he might be King, Amen, of the earth; that he might be the head 
        of this body that would put Satan completely under the foot of the body of Christ – him being the head, we being the body.  This is the purpose of the whole thing.  
        If this is all there is, we are a mess.  That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him: 
        Now we cannot be one with the Father in this sinful state.  It is impossible because we are going to have to die.  But this is his purpose, that in the dispensation of 
        the fullness of time, he might gather together in one all things in Christ, or Christ in each one of us, Amen, which are in heaven and which are on earth.  Now we know 
        those that are in heaven are going to come back with him, and they will be changed and have put on this glorious body, and we are caught up to be with them in the air, 
        with the same identical body, and we will all be as one; God the Father, Jesus Christ, those that are dead and those that are alive.  This is the hope.  This is the 
        plan of God.  And where did he say it?  ‘Which are on earth.’  Us that are on earth, even in him.</p>
    
    
    <p class="w3-justify">So we will be absolutely one, with the same body that God the Father has; that when he put his hands up in front of Moses, when Moses asked him to 
        let him see him in his glory, the same God that says, “You can see my hinder parts,” Amen.  That does not sound like a spirit to me.  Does it to you?  When he says, 
        "You cannot see me in my glory and in all my authority and my power and live," but he said, "I am going to hide you in this rock, in this cleft in this rock, and when 
        I go by," he said, "I will hold my hand up when I go by, so you cannot look upon me, but when I go by, you can look at my hinder parts".  Now, that is ridiculous if we 
        think that was a spirit.  He had a flesh, and he has a flesh and bone body.  And Jesus came in the exact likeness of the Father, Amen.  He said, "If you have seen me, 
        you have seen the Father," Amen.  I mean how stupid can we get, some of the false teachings that we have gargled down and swallowed, Amen.  We have been flitting around 
        here like a bunch of spirits.  That is a lot of baloney.  We are made kings and priests to rule and reign on this earth in bodies, Amen, and set up a kingdom of 
        righteousness.  We are still going to have snow.  We are going to have streets.  We are going to have houses.  This is what it is all about.  Amen.  There is going to 
        be a kingdom here.  Doesn’t he say all the nations shall flow into it?  It is a real kingdom.  I get a little excited, I guess.  Amen, this excites me. In whom also we 
        have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will: Well, we are predestinated?  
        That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ. In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: 
        in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise, What is the promise?  Life everlasting, whether you are awake or whether you are 
        asleep.  That is the promise.  We are sealed unto that, Amen, if we go on, but there is a work to be done.  This root has to come out, Amen, before that can be, because 
        remember, he is coming for a church without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, Amen. ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise. Which is the earnest of our 
        inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">Amen, now, ‘which is the down payment,’ – the earnest money: when you pay down on a house, you call it earnest money – to keep it until the deal is 
        closed, until you obtain the house.  So ‘which is the down payment of our inheritance’ – the Holy Ghost; until we redeem it, completely redeem, the purchased 
        possession – until we come into that completely changed body that is exactly like the Father and Jesus Christ.  That death is done away with.  The curse of death is 
        done away with, unto who?  The praise of the Father, Amen.  It took the death of Christ and the shedding of his blood to destroy that blood or beast animal nature of 
        the first creation.  Not just a covering for sin, but to destroy it. There is a process going on inside of us.  You wonder why you have to suffer, why you have to wail 
        and cry, and why you do things, and then you just nearly die because you had done them.  That is God working in there, pulling out some of those things out of your 
        flesh that cannot behave itself, Amen, that wants to spit back instead of being quiet when God says be quiet.  Jesus was never frustrated, and he said that he had to 
        overcome.  He was born with a body.  He was tempted in all points like as we, but he overcame, yet without sin.  But we have sin.  We have all sinned.  We were born in 
        sin, Amen, Amen, and have come short of the glory of God, that is for sure.  But God has made the way, not just to be saved and to be filled with the Holy Ghost and die 
        in the grave, but that we might be fully redeemed, Amen.</p>   
  

    <p class="w3-justify">Man became like the beast of the field.  Christ will destroy this because the beast of the field has blood.  Man became like the beast of the field.  
        But that is going to change.  He made man of a higher order, a flesh and bone spiritual being, Amen.  We were not made to be like the beast of the field, originally.  
        That was the difference between man and beast.  So when Adam sinned then that whole thing started to change.  Now Adam did not die the next day or that day, but there 
        was a change.  And the curse is death.  We know that is what the curse is.  So God wants to eliminate it, and he is going to eliminate it.  Christ will destroy this 
        beast nature by his blood and spirit. We will be flesh and bone bodies, like God the Father and Christ; all really one.  How are you going to be one with them, except 
        you become as they are, flesh and bone?  How are you going to be one?  There would be a difference.  We cannot be one, absolutely one, with them until that change 
        comes, and the only way that change is coming is to just let God work on you, just lay still.  You may squeal a little bit; just lay still and let him do the work.  
        He has the power to take every bit of that Adam nature out.  We do not even know what is in us.  Only God knows what is in us.  But he has the power, and the authority, 
        and the rulership over us, if we will just give ourselves as a vessel unto him and let him smash us and crush us and remold us and rework us until he makes us that 
        perfect vessel, by his appearing.  And he says, ‘For as many as are looking for him, shall he appear.’  He will appear and make that change.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">Now I do not expect the whole world to see him at that time, because he says, ‘He will come as a thief in the night and as many, just as many as are 
        looking for him,’ that has this message, will he appear, and has an understanding of what his appearing is, to change this vile body like unto his glorious body.  
        Remember, God cannot die, so if we are going to be one with him and be exactly in his image, as he says, Christ had to take on a flesh body to accomplish this, like 
        Adam.  This is why Christ had to come, be born of Mary, become a flesh and blood man that he might be able to die that we would not have to die, Amen.  I praise God for 
        the revelation.  And we do not have to die.  You can help yourself and die if you want to, but I chose not to, Amen.  Praise God for his Word.  What would we do without 
        the Word of God?  Pray tell me, what would we do? In the scriptures, Paul says that he could not come in without us.  They cannot come in except we hear this message, 
        and believe it, and work with it, and work with God, and let him do it in our bodies.  Amen.  And when that happens, then, hallelujah, we will all be one, Amen.  
        And they can obtain their bodies.</p>   
   

    <p class="w3-justify">They (the 144,000 in the cloud of witnesses) absolutely must hear this message.  They are rooting and saying, “Come on.  Come on.  Get with it.  
        Get with it.  We want to get back here.  We want to do the work God has called us to do.”  We have to put Satan down.  Amen.  We have to put Satan down.  We have to 
        crush that ole boy, Amen, and we cannot do it in the state that we are in now.  We can resist him.  We can cast him out and so on and so forth but there is a people 
        that are going to go forth, Amen, that is going to have complete authority over him even as Jesus had.  Amen.  Praise God. Do you know that Abraham and Isaac and Jacob 
        and Job – Job said, "I know in the last days I will stand upon the earth in this flesh though the skin worms eat it, yet shall I stand, on the earth."  You know that 
        God spoke to Daniel and said, "Seal the book," but in the last days he would stand upon the earth.  Amen.  But they cannot come back until this people is prepared 
        because the changing is going to come at the same time for those that are gone and for us here.</p>
    
    
    <p class="w3-justify">This message has to go forth.  God wants to put this body in order, Amen, so that it will be self-sustaining.  I know what God spoke to me this 
        morning.  So I can go out and teach this message.  It is a fire in my bones that won’t quit.  People have to know.  They have to know, Amen, that they do not have to 
        die.  They have to get a hold of this message, believe it in their hearts and work on this spirit, this sinful devil nature that Adam created, Amen, by his 
        disobedience.  And God is determined that there is a people coming forth in this generation that will never see death.  (God has spoken that so many times to me, 
        that actually, it is ridiculous that I cannot get a hold of it like I should.) He said to me, "You shall never taste of death," many times.  He said, "You live because 
        I live.  It is not your life that you are living but it is my life in you that is living."  My very life that I am living in this earth, in this flesh, is the life of 
        Christ in me that is causing me to live.  Amen.  And that is not any glory to me, but it is because he has chosen that in this day, and in this hour, there is a people 
        that is to come forth in the likeness of God the Father, Amen, exactly as one.  When Jesus said, "If you have seen me you have seen the Father," we are going to be in 
        that likeness, Amen, of him, and we will be one.  Hallelujah.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">Let us go on into perfection.  Well, you will not be perfect until you change, like God the Father is perfect.  Half way won’t do it.  We must go on 
        into perfection.  And when you get a notion to do something that is not right, for goodness sake get on your face.  I do not care if you are in the street.  I am 
        determined about this thing. God wants a people, and he is going to have a people that are going to come into that place where he can change them by his Spirit; 
        where we can be one in that glorious realm, where there is no death, no sickness, no nothing, and we will be like God the Father and like God the Son.  Amen, that is 
        our inheritance.  We have a right to claim it.  He has promised it to us.  Hasn't he?  Over and over and over again in the scriptures he has promised us that it is 
        our rightful inheritance.  That is why the Lord came, that all that mess could be put away and be over with – this death and everything else – and that the curse 
        could be absolutely taken out of the earth, and he could have a perfect people again.  God has not changed his mind.  He is still going to have flesh men to rule the 
        earth just like Adam started out and failed.  God did not change his mind.  And Satan did not sneak up on God and do it.  It was God’s plan.  He is going to have a 
        perfect people, Amen, in the end, that are going to make this earth in righteousness, Amen, and overcome everything, everything in us.  But we have to let him do it.</p>   
  

    <p class="w3-justify">This old stinking mind and flesh that wants to continually do evil, it has to go.  It has to go or we are not coming in.  Amen.  But we need to be 
        encouraged because Christ said, "Fear not.  Fear not little one," because he has overcome the world for us.  He knows the way.  All we have to do is follow him.  He 
        has already been there.  He overcame all the flesh and everything, that we might know how to overcome.  He said, "By much tribulation shall ye enter the kingdom."  
        Much suffering.  He overcame.  Even Jesus Christ overcame by suffering.  And we think we are going to get by with any less.  I am quite sure we have not quite come 
        up to the level of Christ yet, and yet look what he had to suffer.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">Paul is anxious. Paul was the one that received this heavenly vision and was carried into the third realm of the Spirit, or the third heaven, 
        into the highest realm of the Spirit that there is, because three is completeness, and that is the highest realm.  But he said, “It is unlawful.”  God showed him 
        things that were unlawful for him to speak.  He could not even tell it.  There are mysteries hidden in here.  God said, "It is given unto thee to know the mysteries 
        of the kingdom."  Not mysteries of the heavens or the stars or the planets, but he said, "It is given unto thee to know the mysteries of the kingdom," of his kingdom.  
        Imagine how Paul feels, Amen, how anxious, how he is rooting us on.  No wonder he would appear, Amen, and say, "Come on; get with it."  He still is a spirit.  We cannot 
        see him; we do not see spirits, unless God lets us see them, but he is still around.  We are compassed about with clouds of witnesses, Amen, that are listening and 
        rooting for us to go on.  Amen.  And we are compassed by angels here continually in this place and I know that.  That the angels of God are with us.</p>   
   

    <p class="w3-justify">God is more concerned about this message, the kingdom message going forth than anything else right now, because everything will be at a standstill 
        until this kingdom message is preached.  The message of the kingdom.  He says, "When this message of the kingdom is preached in the whole world and every nation, then 
        shall the end come."  Do you know what the end is?</p>
    
    
    <p class="w3-justify">The end of flesh man’s rule:
        that is the end, and the kingdom begins When this message of the kingdom
        is preached in all the earth
        and every nation.
        Then shall the end come.</p>
    
    
    <p class="w3-justify">This is in Matthew 24 if you want to look it up.  Matthew 24, when they asked him these questions – the disciples – when they took him apart and 
        asked him these questions.  They wanted to know when the end would come.  He said after this message is taught.  So this is the kingdom message, and it is going 
        forth. Matthew 24:14 And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.</p>
