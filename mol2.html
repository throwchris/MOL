    <p class="w3-justify">The curse that Adam took on was 
        death.  Wasn't it?  That was the curse.  But in the original beginning, he was made like unto God the Father and Jesus Christ.  He said, "Let us make man in our image."  
        Well, they could not die, and they did not have blood.  Jesus said, "Restore unto me the glory that I had with thee from the beginning."  So, in the beginning he was flesh 
        and bone, not flesh and blood.  And that is where we will come to.  That will be the change.  But, are you afraid of it?  You will be a lot smarter than you are now when 
        we come into that state, because we will know all things at that time.  This corruptible blood body must be changed into his beautiful resurrected body.  Then death shall 
        be done away with.</p> 
        
       

    
    <p class="w3-justify">By the way, when the Lord gave me that vision and showed me his beautiful hands of his resurrected body years ago, I have had a longing for that ever 
        since, because there is no way that I can describe the beauty of that flesh.  It is simply something that you cannot explain, but he was as plain as I am looking at you 
        or anyone else.  But it was just his hands and his garment; he did not show me his whole body but he showed me the beautiful flesh of his hands.  And he was so intimate 
        about it with me, so secretive about it and so loving and so close to me and I said, "Lord."  I had such a desire.  I was crying out to God and I was saying, "Oh Lord, 
        I have such a desire to know what this is all about."  I really wanted to know what kind of a change, what kind of a body we will have.  “And what is your resurrected 
        body; what did it look like?”  It is no wonder they did not recognize him.  I mean it, because that flesh is something beyond anything that you can imagine, and every 
        one of us will receive a change, a new body, a flesh and bone body that is going to be like unto his glorious body.</p>   
  
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong>John 5:26</strong>  
        <span class="w3-text-red"><strong>For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;</strong> </span> 
        Now, if the Son is in us, and he gets complete control and all of the Adamic nature is taken out of us, then that life just naturally has to come forth.  There has to 
        be a change. 
        
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong>John 20:21-22</strong>  <strong>Then said Jesus to them again,</strong> <span class="w3-text-red"><strong>Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, 
        even so send I you.</strong> </span>
        <strong> And when he had said this, he breathed on 
        them, and saith unto them,</strong>  <span class="w3-text-red"><strong>Receive ye the Holy Ghost:</strong> </span>  All right, now you see when he first sent them out ‘As the Father 
        hath sent me so send I you’.  Now that is what 
        he is saying to us again, to complete that work in us.  We are his disciples also.  As the Father had sent Jesus into the earth to do this work that he might be a 
        complete man, that the Adamic nature and everything would be taken out, he says 'so send I you'.  And as he was in the earth, so are we.  So he has sent us.  ‘And when 
        he had said this, he breathed,’ he gave them that power by the breath.  Remember how Adam lived, because God breathed the breath of life, eternal life, into him.  
        The life of the Spirit, the life of God, that eternal life that cannot die was breathed into him.</p>   
    
    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong>Galatians 3:3</strong> </span> 
        <strong>Are ye so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?</strong>  
        Do you think for one minute that we can come into this relationship and get rid of this curse of sin through any works of the flesh?  Absolutely not.  
        It is everything is by the Spirit.  As we let this life, this eternal life, this Jesus Christ, this life man live in us and take complete control of our bodies 
        and of our spirits and of our soul; as we completely give over everything, every part of us unto him, this life just naturally has to come forth.  That is the 
        only way that it can come forth.
        
        <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 9</p>    

        
    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong> Ephesians 1:7-14 </strong> </span>
        <strong>In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins,</strong>  Through his blood, that is the forgiveness of sins, like we said before, that is what the 
        blood was for. <strong>according to the riches of his grace; Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence; Having made known unto us the mystery of his 
            will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself:</strong>  And what was the purpose of the Father? That we be Sons.</p>   
   
    <p class="w3-justify">That we might be rulers of the earth again in Jesus Christ, the body of Christ; that he might be King, Amen, of the earth; that he might be the head 
        of this body that would put Satan completely under the foot of the body of Christ – him being the head, we being the body.  This is the purpose of the whole thing.  
        If this is all there is, we are a mess. <strong>That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, 
        and which are on earth; even in him:</strong>   
        Now we cannot be one with the Father in this sinful state.  It is impossible because we are going to have to die.  But this is his purpose, that in the dispensation of 
        the fullness of time, he might gather together in one all things in Christ, or Christ in each one of us, Amen, which are in heaven and which are on earth.  Now we know 
        those that are in heaven are going to come back with him, and they will be changed and have put on this glorious body, and we are caught up to be with them in the air, 
        with the same identical body, and we will all be as one; God the Father, Jesus Christ, those that are dead and those that are alive.  This is the hope.  This is the 
        plan of God.  And where did he say it?  ‘Which are on earth.’  Us that are on earth, even in him.</p>
    
    
    <p class="w3-justify">So we will be absolutely one, with the same body that God the Father has; that when he put his hands up in front of Moses, when Moses asked him to 
        let him see him in his glory, the same God that says, “You can see my hinder parts,” Amen.  That does not sound like a spirit to me.  Does it to you?  When he says, 
        "You cannot see me in my glory and in all my authority and my power and live," but he said, "I am going to hide you in this rock, in this cleft in this rock, and when 
        I go by," he said, "I will hold my hand up when I go by, so you cannot look upon me, but when I go by, you can look at my hinder parts".  Now, that is ridiculous if we 
        think that was a spirit.  He had a flesh, and he has a flesh and bone body.  And Jesus came in the exact likeness of the Father, Amen.  He said, "If you have seen me, 
        you have seen the Father," Amen.  I mean how stupid can we get, some of the false teachings that we have gargled down and swallowed, Amen.  We have been flitting around 
        here like a bunch of spirits.  That is a lot of baloney.</p>
        
    <p class="w3-right-align" style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 10</p>    
        
        
    <p class="w3-justify">We are made kings and priests to rule and reign on this earth in bodies, Amen, and set up a kingdom of 
        righteousness.  We are still going to have snow.  We are going to have streets.  We are going to have houses.  This is what it is all about.  Amen.  There is going to 
        be a kingdom here.  Doesn’t he say all the nations shall flow into it?  It is a real kingdom.  I get a little excited, I guess.  Amen, this excites me.<strong> In whom also we 
            have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will:</strong>   Well, we are predestinated?  
        <strong>That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ. In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: 
        in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,</strong>  What is the promise?  Life everlasting, whether you are awake or whether you are 
        asleep.  That is the promise.  We are sealed unto that, Amen, if we go on, but there is a work to be done.  This root has to come out, Amen, before that can be, because 
        remember, he is coming for a church without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, Amen. <strong>ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise. Which is the earnest of our 
        inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.</strong> </p>   
    
    <p class="w3-justify">Amen, now, ‘which is the down payment,’ – the earnest money: when you pay down on a house, you call it earnest money – to keep it until the deal is 
        closed, until you obtain the house.  So ‘which is the down payment of our inheritance’ – the Holy Ghost; until we redeem it, completely redeem, the purchased 
        possession – until we come into that completely changed body that is exactly like the Father and Jesus Christ.  That death is done away with.  The curse of death is 
        done away with, unto who?  The praise of the Father, Amen.  It took the death of Christ and the shedding of his blood to destroy that blood or beast animal nature of 
        the first creation.  Not just a covering for sin, but to destroy it. There is a process going on inside of us.  You wonder why you have to suffer, why you have to wail 
        and cry, and why you do things, and then you just nearly die because you had done them.  That is God working in there, pulling out some of those things out of your 
        flesh that cannot behave itself, Amen, that wants to spit back instead of being quiet when God says be quiet.  Jesus was never frustrated, and he said that he had to 
        overcome.  He was born with a body.  He was tempted in all points like as we, but he overcame, yet without sin.  But we have sin.  We have all sinned.  We were born in 
        sin, Amen, Amen, and have come short of the glory of God, that is for sure.  But God has made the way, not just to be saved and to be filled with the Holy Ghost and die 
        in the grave, but that we might be fully redeemed, Amen.</p>   
  
    <p class="w3-justify">Man became like the beast of the field.  Christ will destroy this because the beast of the field has blood.  Man became like the beast of the field.  
        But that is going to change.  He made man of a higher order, a flesh and bone spiritual being, Amen.  We were not made to be like the beast of the field, originally.  
        That was the difference between man and beast.  So when Adam sinned then that whole thing started to change.  Now Adam did not die the next day or that day, but there 
        was a change.  And the curse is death.  We know that is what the curse is.  So God wants to eliminate it, and he is going to eliminate it.  Christ will destroy this 
        beast nature by his blood and spirit.</p> 
        
    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 11</p>    
        
    
        <p class="w3-justify">We will be flesh and bone bodies, like God the Father and Christ; all really one.  How are you going to be one with them, except 
        you become as they are, flesh and bone?  How are you going to be one?  There would be a difference.  We cannot be one, absolutely one, with them until that change 
        comes, and the only way that change is coming is to just let God work on you, just lay still.  You may squeal a little bit; just lay still and let him do the work.  
        He has the power to take every bit of that Adam nature out.  We do not even know what is in us.  Only God knows what is in us.  But he has the power, and the authority, 
        and the rulership over us, if we will just give ourselves as a vessel unto him and let him smash us and crush us and remold us and rework us until he makes us that 
        perfect vessel, by his appearing.  And he says, ‘For as many as are looking for him, shall he appear.’  He will appear and make that change.</p>   
    
    <p class="w3-justify">Now I do not expect the whole world to see him at that time, because he says, ‘He will come as a thief in the night and as many, just as many as are 
        looking for him,’ that has this message, will he appear, and has an understanding of what his appearing is, to change this vile body like unto his glorious body.  
        Remember, God cannot die, so if we are going to be one with him and be exactly in his image, as he says, Christ had to take on a flesh body to accomplish this, like 
        Adam.  This is why Christ had to come, be born of Mary, become a flesh and blood man that he might be able to die that we would not have to die, Amen.  I praise God for 
        the revelation.  And we do not have to die.  You can help yourself and die if you want to, but I chose not to, Amen.  Praise God for his Word.  What would we do without 
        the Word of God?  Pray tell me, what would we do? In the scriptures, Paul says that he could not come in without us.  They cannot come in except we hear this message, 
        and believe it, and work with it, and work with God, and let him do it in our bodies.  Amen.  And when that happens, then, hallelujah, we will all be one, Amen.  
        And they can obtain their bodies.</p>   
   
    <p class="w3-justify">They (the 144,000 in the cloud of witnesses) absolutely must hear this message.  They are rooting and saying, “Come on.  Come on.  Get with it.  
        Get with it.  We want to get back here.  We want to do the work God has called us to do.”  We have to put Satan down.  Amen.  We have to put Satan down.  We have to 
        crush that ole boy, Amen, and we cannot do it in the state that we are in now.  We can resist him.  We can cast him out and so on and so forth but there is a people 
        that are going to go forth, Amen, that is going to have complete authority over him even as Jesus had.  Amen.  Praise God. Do you know that Abraham and Isaac and Jacob 
        and Job – Job said, "I know in the last days I will stand upon the earth in this flesh though the skin worms eat it, yet shall I stand, on the earth."  You know that 
        God spoke to Daniel and said, "Seal the book," but in the last days he would stand upon the earth.  Amen.  But they cannot come back until this people is prepared 
        because the changing is going to come at the same time for those that are gone and for us here.</p>
    
    
    <p class="w3-right-align" style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 12</p>
    
    
    <p class="w3-justify">This message has to go forth.  God wants to put this body in order, Amen, so that it will be self-sustaining.  I know what God spoke to me this 
        morning.  So I can go out and teach this message.  It is a fire in my bones that won’t quit.  People have to know.  They have to know, Amen, that they do not have to 
        die.  They have to get a hold of this message, believe it in their hearts and work on this spirit, this sinful devil nature that Adam created, Amen, by his 
        disobedience.  And God is determined that there is a people coming forth in this generation that will never see death.  (God has spoken that so many times to me, 
        that actually, it is ridiculous that I cannot get a hold of it like I should.) He said to me, "You shall never taste of death," many times.  He said, "You live because 
        I live.  It is not your life that you are living but it is my life in you that is living."  My very life that I am living in this earth, in this flesh, is the life of 
        Christ in me that is causing me to live.  Amen.  And that is not any glory to me, but it is because he has chosen that in this day, and in this hour, there is a people 
        that is to come forth in the likeness of God the Father, Amen, exactly as one.  When Jesus said, "If you have seen me you have seen the Father," we are going to be in 
        that likeness, Amen, of him, and we will be one.  Hallelujah.</p>   
    
    <p class="w3-justify">Let us go on into perfection.  Well, you will not be perfect until you change, like God the Father is perfect.  Half way won’t do it.  We must go on 
        into perfection.  And when you get a notion to do something that is not right, for goodness sake get on your face.  I do not care if you are in the street.  I am 
        determined about this thing. God wants a people, and he is going to have a people that are going to come into that place where he can change them by his Spirit; 
        where we can be one in that glorious realm, where there is no death, no sickness, no nothing, and we will be like God the Father and like God the Son.  Amen, that is 
        our inheritance.  We have a right to claim it.  He has promised it to us.  Hasn't he?  Over and over and over again in the scriptures he has promised us that it is 
        our rightful inheritance.  That is why the Lord came, that all that mess could be put away and be over with – this death and everything else – and that the curse 
        could be absolutely taken out of the earth, and he could have a perfect people again.  God has not changed his mind.  He is still going to have flesh men to rule the 
        earth just like Adam started out and failed.  God did not change his mind.  And Satan did not sneak up on God and do it.  It was God’s plan.  He is going to have a 
        perfect people, Amen, in the end, that are going to make this earth in righteousness, Amen, and overcome everything, everything in us.  But we have to let him do it.</p>   
  
    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 13</p>
    
    
    <p class="w3-justify">This old stinking mind and flesh that wants to continually do evil, it has to go.  It has to go or we are not coming in.  Amen.  But we need to be 
        encouraged because Christ said, "Fear not.  Fear not little one," because he has overcome the world for us.  He knows the way.  All we have to do is follow him.  He 
        has already been there.  He overcame all the flesh and everything, that we might know how to overcome.  He said, "By much tribulation shall ye enter the kingdom."  
        Much suffering.  He overcame.  Even Jesus Christ overcame by suffering.  And we think we are going to get by with any less.  I am quite sure we have not quite come 
        up to the level of Christ yet, and yet look what he had to suffer.</p>   
    
    <p class="w3-justify">Paul is anxious. Paul was the one that received this heavenly vision and was carried into the third realm of the Spirit, or the third heaven, 
        into the highest realm of the Spirit that there is, because three is completeness, and that is the highest realm.  But he said, “It is unlawful.”  God showed him 
        things that were unlawful for him to speak.  He could not even tell it.  There are mysteries hidden in here.  God said, "It is given unto thee to know the mysteries 
        of the kingdom."  Not mysteries of the heavens or the stars or the planets, but he said, "It is given unto thee to know the mysteries of the kingdom," of his kingdom.  
        Imagine how Paul feels, Amen, how anxious, how he is rooting us on.  No wonder he would appear, Amen, and say, "Come on; get with it."  He still is a spirit.  We cannot 
        see him; we do not see spirits, unless God lets us see them, but he is still around.  We are compassed about with clouds of witnesses, Amen, that are listening and 
        rooting for us to go on.  Amen.  And we are compassed by angels here continually in this place and I know that.  That the angels of God are with us.</p>   
   
    <p class="w3-justify">God is more concerned about this message, the kingdom message going forth than anything else right now, because everything will be at a standstill 
        until this kingdom message is preached.  The message of the kingdom.  He says, "When this message of the kingdom is preached in the whole world and every nation, then 
        shall the end come."  Do you know what the end is?</p>
    
    
    <p class="w3-justify">The end of flesh man’s rule:
        that is the end, and the kingdom begins When this message of the kingdom
        is preached in all the earth
        and every nation.
        Then shall the end come.</p>
    
    
    <p class="w3-justify">This is in Matthew 24 if you want to look it up.  Matthew 24, when they asked him these questions – the disciples – when they took him apart and 
        asked him these questions.  They wanted to know when the end would come.  He said after this message is taught.  So this is the kingdom message, and it is going 
        forth.
